# basic_company_website
A basic company website I made from HTML CSS JS for my internship

This is a multipaged website that shows
  1. the home page
  2. the products page
  3. the about us page
  4. and a page with locations of the offices, which when clicke upon show you the gogle maps location of said office

TO RUN THE PROJECT, simply download it and run the mainpage.html file.
