<h1>What do we do</h1>
<div class="wdwd">
<div class="tanning">
<h2>TANNING</h2>
<p>Tanning is the process of treating animal hides or skins to convert them into leather.
     It involves chemically or mechanically altering the protein structure of the skin 
     to make it more durable, flexible, and resistant to decomposition
     Tanning is a crucial step in the leather processing industry that transforms raw animal hides into durable and usable leather.
      <br>The process of tanning involves treating the animal hides with tannins,
      which are naturally occurring compounds that bind with the proteins in the skin, making it less susceptible to decomposition and more resistant to wear and tear.
     <br>Tanning serves several important purposes in leather production. Firstly, it preserves the animal hides by preventing them from putrefying and decomposing. 
     Without tanning, animal skins would quickly rot and become unusable. Tanning also enhances the strength, flexibility, and durability of the leather, making it suitable for a wide range of applications such as shoes, bags, upholstery, and garments.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="retaining">
<h2>RETAINING</h2>
<p>Retanning is a stage in the leather tanning process that follows the initial tanning. After the initial tanning,
     the leather may undergo further treatment to enhance its properties.
    <br>
    retaining is the process of preserving the hide or skin of an animal after it has been removed from the animal's body. This process is essential to prevent decomposition and ensure that the hide can be transformed into durable leather.
<br>
    Retaining typically involves several steps to halt the natural decomposition process and prepare the hide for further processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="Fatliqouring">
<h2>FATLIQUORING</h2>
<p>Fatliquoring is a process in leather manufacturing that involves adding fatliquors to the leather. 
    Fatliquors are substances, typically oils or emulsions, that are used to lubricate the leather fibers, making them softer, more flexible, and improving their ability to absorb water.<br>
    fatliquoring is to replenish the natural oils and fats that were removed or damaged during the tanning process. This is important because tanning agents can cause the leather to become stiff and lose its natural lubrication. 
    Fatliquoring helps restore the suppleness and pliability of the leather, making it more comfortable to use and wear. <br>
    There are various types of fatliquors available, including natural, semi-synthetic, and synthetic options. Natural fatliquors are derived from animal or vegetable sources, while synthetic fatliquors are chemically formulated compounds. The selection of fatliquor depends on factors such as the desired softness, waterproofing properties, and intended use of the leather.</p>
</div>
<div class="Dyeing">
<h2>DYEING</h2>
<p>Dyeing is the process of imparting color to leather. 
    It involves applying dyes or pigments to the leather surface to achieve the desired color or shade. Dyeing can be done using various techniques,
     such as drum dyeing, spray dyeing, or hand dyeing.
     Dyeing is a fundamental process in leather processing that involves the application of colorants to the surface of the leather. <br>It is one of the final steps in leather production and plays a crucial role in enhancing the aesthetic appeal and 
     marketability of the leather. The dyeing process allows for a wide range of colors and effects to be applied to the leather, giving it a desired appearance and character.<br>
     After dyeing, the leather may undergo additional finishing processes to enhance its appearance and functionality. Finishing can include operations such as buffing, polishing, embossing, or the application of protective coatings. <br>These processes help achieve the desired texture, gloss, or special effects on the leather surface.</p>

<div class="Fininshing" >
<h2>FINISHING</h2>
<p>Finishing is the final stage in the leather processing sequence. 
   It involves applying various treatments, coatings, or finishes to the leather to enhance its appearance, texture, and durabilit
   Finishing is a leather processing that occurs after dyeing and involves various treatments and processes to enhance the appearance, feel, durability, and functional properties of the leather. <br>
   The finishing stage adds the final touches to the leather, giving it the desired look, texture, and performance characteristics.
<br>
   The finishing process in leather processing is essential for adding the final touches and enhancing the visual appeal, texture, and durability of the leather. It allows for customization, protection, and value addition, making the leather suitable for a wide range of applications in industries such as fashion, automotive, upholstery, and accessories.
